<h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?<h2></center>
    <center>
    <p><strong><em>Lorem Ipsum</em></strong> is simply <tt>dummy text </tt>of the <code>printing and typesetting </code>industry.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br> when an unknown printer <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">google</a> took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen.<br> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop<br> <b>publishing software</b> like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
    <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
       <p> There are many variations of passages of <cite>Lorem Ipsum</cite> available, <br>but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. <br>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.<br> All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,<br> making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over <em><strong>200 Latin words</strong></em>, <br>combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. <br>The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p></center>

      <center> <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
       <p><pre>Contrary to popular belief</pre> Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,<br> making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,<br> looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ " target="_blank">amazon</a> the cites of the word in classical literature,<br> discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.<br> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular website like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/" target="_blank">BBC </a>during the Renaissance. <br>The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
       
       <blockquote>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum</blockquote> used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. <br>Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, <br>accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham</p></center>
